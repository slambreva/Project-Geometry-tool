# Project-Geometry-tool
Project for my course at Sofia Uni

The project Geometry tool consists of numerous functions that work with points (their coordinates) and lines (their coeficients) and show as output different things depending on the choice of the user.
The user can choose a number to call a function and get an equation of a line, coordinates of intersectional point, etc.
